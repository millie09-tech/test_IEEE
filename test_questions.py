  Given a list of integers, write a list comprehension that generates a new list containing only the even numbers that are greater than 10 and less than 50 from the original list.

  NO LOOPS only list comprehension.

  For example, if the input is:

  lst = [5, 12, 18, 25, 30, 45, 55, 60, 11]
  The output should be:

  [12, 18, 30]

"""

Write a function that finds the longest word in a given string and returns a tuple of (word, lengthOfWord, IndexInSentence)

Example:
Input: "I love programming in Python"
Output: ("programming", 11, 3)

returns 11 because the length of programming is 11

returns 3 because it is the third word in the sentence

FOR AN EMPTY sentence return -1 for each value in tuple.

The Jacobsthal sequence can be defined as the following:

J(0) = 0
J(1) = 1
J(n) = J(n-1) + 2J(n-2)

So, the second Jacobsthal number would be 1, the third would be 3, the fourth would be 5, the fifth 11, etc.

Using recursion return the nth Jacobsthal number.
Values of n to be tested: 0 <= n <= 30

print(jacobsthal_num(5)) ==> 11
print(jacobsthal_num(7)) ==> 43
